    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is Case Rosenfelt. I am an eleven ( soon to be twelve ) year-old in the sixth grade. I am a top student in my school, BASIS Tucson North, and I always try my best.</p>
    <p>Family is truly everything to me. They are the ones who care about me and keep me going. If it weren't for their constant and unfailing supply of love and support, I would not be here today.
